**Triggers harvesting of resources when butchering**

Any resource that can be harvested from an animal will be harvested when butchering a dead animal.

To be able to harvest resources from animals that explode on death you can use [BoomMod Expanded](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2359846788) or similar mod.

Also added a setting to lower the amount of resources gained from butchered wild animals.

Since modding is just a hobby for me I expect no donations to keep modding. If you still want to show your support you can gift me anything from my [Wishlist](https://store.steampowered.com/wishlist/id/Mlie) or buy me a cup of tea.
